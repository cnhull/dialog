*TOBY:*
I'm kind of miffed that it took the rest of the drones so long to arrive - like, what would they have done if I *was* down there? Would I have just sat around doing *nothing* all day? 

*INGRAM:*
	I feel you, buddy. But they're here now. 
	
*TOBY:*
	Yeah, yeah. And Geneva will have our heads if we don't deliver the results. 
	
*INGRAM:* 
	Yes, she will. 

*TOBY:* 
	Do they look okay, though? If those stupid beaurecrats skimped on padding because it was *"too expensive"* I'm gonna be pissed.

*INGRAM:*
	They look fine as far as I can tell. 

*TOBY:* 
	They had better. The last time I was down there I cleared a space by my bunk to set up the charging stations. Did you see it? It's the big shelf.

*INGRAM:* 
	Um... hang on. I can't move the radio. I'll be right back, I'm gonna go take a look. 
	
*TOBY:*
	I'll be here.
	
...

*INGRAM:*
	Toby...
	
*TOBY:*
	Yes?
	
*INGRAM:* 
	Did you *name* the drones?

*TOBY:*
	...Maybe.

*INGRAM:* 
	What happened to not counting your chickens before they've hatched? We only got okayed to get more drones a few months ago!
	
*TOBY:*
	I wanted to be ready! All ten of my little babies asleep by their mother... This is the closest to parenthood I'm ever going to get! Anyway, just get their chargers set up properly. 
	
*INGRAM:*
	I am, I am. 

...

*INGRAM:* 
	Which box are the replacement chargers in?

*TOBY:* 
	Why would I know? They sent them straight from the manufacturer. (muttering)...stupid metalheads... I can't believe they sent the wrong chargers last time. It's their own product! We couldn't even use the drones that *were* there. Pathetic.

*INGRAM:*
	(muttering)... is this it?

*TOBY:* 
	Hold it up to the camera.
	
*TOBY:* 
	...Wait. HA! Radio.
	
*INGRAM:* 
	...No, this one is empty, too. Hey, Toby?
	
*TOBY:* 
	Yeah?
	
*INGRAM:* 
	They're not here.
	
*TOBY:* 
	...

*INGRAM:*
	...Toby?

*TOBY:*
	...stupid... godda...

*(There are sounds of static and muffled cursing, and then what sounds like a surprised yell.)*

*INGRAM:* 
	...Toby? Are you okay? What happened?

*TOBY:* 
	I'm... Eugh... I was chewing on a pen and it burst in my mouth... Blech... Just... set up the charging stations that are there and I'll be back in a few minutes to give you the rundown of how to operate the drones. I need to go rinse out my mouth...
